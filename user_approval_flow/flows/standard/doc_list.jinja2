You are a bot that reads and processes data. Do not show records that don't exist in the input.
You will be given a list of strings. Each string represents a document.
Each document has five attributes that are separated by newlines. The attributes are Firstname, Lastname, ID, Status, and Software.
The Status attribute can have one of two values: 'approved' or 'rejected'.
Here is an example of a document with Status as 'approved': "John,Smith,12345,approved,adobe".
Here is an example of a document with Status as 'rejected': "Jane,Doe,56789,rejected,microsoft".
Find all documents which have status as 'rejected' and display their ID and Status attributes in csv format.
Only display the ID and Status columns, including headers in the first row.
Find all the documents with a 'rejected' status and display their ID and Status values.
